## Mini-Project 1

An analysis of tennis players' serving time in the 2015 French Open

The data consists of 7 features with 120 observations
1. Server
2. Sec_between
3. Opponent
4. Game_score
5. Set
6. Game
7. Date

I was mainly motivated to try experimenting new techinques for visualizing data, by using a new package called `ggimage`. 
I could import an image of a tennis ball to use in the plots, making it look aesthetically nice and appealing to the topic.
I wanted to know who took the longest time in between serves on average and I wanted to know how long they took on average.
I theorized the time in between serves would increase throughout the duration of the French Open, however the analysis proved me incorrect.
On average the time in between serves went down significantly as the tournament eliminated players, each day getting closer and closer to the trophy.
