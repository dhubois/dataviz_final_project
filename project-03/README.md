# Data Visualization

### Mini-Project 3

A guided visualization project


We are using data from FSU's [Florida Climate Center](https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/climate-data-access-tools/downloadable-data), for a station at Tampa International Airport (TPA) for 2022.
The data consists of 7 features with 365 observations
1. year
2. month
3. day  
4. precipitation
5. max_temp
6. min_temp
7. ave_temp

This project is an opportunity to exercise our creativity and try to think as much as possible about data visualizations. Really, I was thinking about each possible thing,
like the font size of the *x* axis, or how the different plots may have one extra little detail added in.
Trying to emulate the plots is a fantastic way to get the brain thinking about the minute details that could make the plot aesthetically pleasing and get us to doubt decision made.
Like when plot's titles are not capitalized or the *x*/*y* axis starts and ends at a specific point instead of all the data, why would they not be? Does the author want them like that or was it a mistake. With practice comes learning, this envelops everything this class is all about.
Practice, practice, and more practice. All while having fun and creating key insights into data that others may or may not have found already.
